# Causal-Analysis-Recidivism

This repository includes the Google Colab for our final project code for causal analysis (estimate FACE and FACT) in 10-708 Probabilistic Graphical Models and the COMPAS dataset. Results can be derived by running individual cells in the Google Colab file. Dependencies will be installed by initial cells.
